85. List the steps to get file name from a path in PHP.

ANSWER
Step-by-Step Process
 1.Have the full file path
 2.Use basename() function
  This built-in function returns the trailing file name from a path.
 3.Use pathinfo() to extract just the name (without extension)
  This function returns an associative array with components of the path.
 4.Extract only the file name (without extension)
  From the array returned by pathinfo(), use:
 5.Extract the file extension (if needed)

<?php
// Step 1: Define the full file path
$path = "/var/www/html/uploads/document.pdf";
// Step 2: Get file name with extension
$filename = basename($path); // Output: document.pdf
// Step 3: Use pathinfo() to get detailed info
$fileInfo = pathinfo($path);
// Step 4: Extract components
$nameOnly = $fileInfo['filename'];     // document
$extension = $fileInfo['extension'];   // pdf
$directory = $fileInfo['dirname'];     // /var/www/html/uploads
// Step 5: Display the results
echo "Full Path: " . $path . "\n";
echo "File Name (with extension): " . $filename . "\n";
echo "File Name (without extension): " . $nameOnly . "\n";
echo "File Extension: " . $extension . "\n";
echo "Directory Name: " . $directory . "\n";
?>

OUTPUT
Full Path: /var/www/html/uploads/document.pdf
File Name (with extension): document.pdf
File Name (without extension): document
File Extension: pdf
Directory Name: /var/www/html/uploads
