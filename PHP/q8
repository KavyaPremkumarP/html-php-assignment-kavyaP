ANSWER
<?php
function deal() {
    $cost_A = 25;
    $size_A = 11;
    $cost_B = 23;
    $size_B = 9;

    $cost_per_unit_A = $cost_A / $size_A;
    $cost_per_unit_B = $cost_B / $size_B;

    if ($cost_per_unit_A < $cost_per_unit_B) {
        echo "Choose Drink A to save money";
    } elseif ($cost_per_unit_B < $cost_per_unit_A) {
        echo "Choose Drink B to save money";
    } else {
        echo "Both drinks cost the same per unit";
    }
}

deal();
?>
