66. Difference between count() and sizeof() function in PHP.
ANSWER
 Point-wise Comparison of count() vs sizeof()
Functionality
Both functions return the number of elements in an array.

Definition
sizeof() is simply an alias of count() in PHP.

Usage Preference
count() is more commonly used and preferred for clarity and readability.

Performance
There is no performance difference between the two. They work identically.

Syntax
Both use the same syntax:
count($array);  
sizeof($array);


Data Types
Both work primarily with arrays, but can also count elements in objects that implement Countable.

Best Practice
Use count() as it's standard and more recognizable in PHP coding.

INPUT
<?php
$data = ["PHP", "Java", "Python"];
echo "Using count(): " . count($data) . "\n";
echo "Using sizeof(): " . sizeof($data) . "\n";
?>
OUTPUT
Using count(): 3
Using sizeof(): 3
