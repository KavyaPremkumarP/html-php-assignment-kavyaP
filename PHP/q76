76. Write a simple 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days between current day and birthday.

ANSWER
<?php
// Set your birthday (MM-DD format)
$birthday = '10-25';  // October 25
// Get current year and today's date
$currentYear = date('Y');
$today = date('Y-m-d');
// Combine birthday with current year
$birthdayThisYear = date('Y-m-d', strtotime($currentYear . '-' . $birthday));
// If birthday has passed this year, set to next year
if (strtotime($birthdayThisYear) < strtotime($today)) {
    $nextBirthday = date('Y-m-d', strtotime(($currentYear + 1) . '-' . $birthday));
} else {
    $nextBirthday = $birthdayThisYear;
}
// Calculate the difference
$diff = strtotime($nextBirthday) - strtotime($today);
$daysRemaining = ceil($diff / (60 * 60 * 24));
// Display result
echo "ðŸŽ‚ Your next birthday is in <strong>$daysRemaining</strong> day(s)!";
?>

OUTPUT
ðŸŽ‚ Your next birthday is in 68 day(s)!
