75. Build a PHP function that takes the filename and a new line of content as input. Append the new
line of content as a new line at the end of the file.
ANSWER
<?php
function appendLineToFile($filename, $newContent) {
    // Add a newline character at the beginning (if needed)
    $line = PHP_EOL . $newContent;

    // Use file_put_contents with FILE_APPEND flag
    if (file_put_contents($filename, $line, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX)) {
        echo "Line successfully appended to '$filename'.";
    } else {
        echo "Failed to write to file.";
    }
}
// Example usage
appendLineToFile("example.txt", "This is a new line added at the end.");
?>

OUTPUT
Line successfully appended to 'example.txt'.
