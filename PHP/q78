78. Elucidate the steps to read and delete existing cookies in the browser.
ANSWER
What are Cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser, often used to remember login info, user preferences, etc.

Steps to Read Existing Cookies
ðŸ“Œ Step-by-step:
Cookies are stored in the $_COOKIE superglobal array.
You can access them using the cookie name as the key.

Steps to Delete a Cookie
ðŸ“Œ Step-by-step:
Use setcookie() again with the same name.
Set the expiration time in the past.
This tells the browser to remove the cookie.

<?php
// Set cookie for demonstration
setcookie("username", "JohnDoe", time() + 3600); // valid for 1 hour
// Read cookie
if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
    echo "Cookie value: " . $_COOKIE['username'] . "<br>";
} else {
    echo "Cookie not set.<br>";
}
// Delete cookie
setcookie("username", "", time() - 3600);
echo "Cookie 'username' deleted.";
?>

OUTPUT
Cookie not set.
Cookie 'username' deleted.
