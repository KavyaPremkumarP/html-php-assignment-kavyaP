93. Write a PHP program that keeps track of how many times a visitor has loaded the page.

ANSWER
<?php
// Check if the 'visits' cookie is set
if (isset($_COOKIE['visits'])) {
    // If it exists, increment its value
    $visits = $_COOKIE['visits'] + 1;
} else {
    // If not set, start at 1
    $visits = 1;
}
// Set or update the 'visits' cookie (expires in 1 hour)
setcookie('visits', $visits, time() + 3600);
?>
