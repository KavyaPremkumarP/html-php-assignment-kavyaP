61. Recall the steps to delete an element from an array?
ANSWER
Steps to Delete an Element from an Array in PHP
1. Identify the key or index
Determine which element you want to remove based on its key (for associative arrays) or index (for indexed arrays).

2. Use the unset() function
Use unset($array[$key]); to delete the element.

3. (Optional) Reindex the array
If it's an indexed array and you want to reindex it (reset the numeric keys), use array_values().

<?php
// Step 1: Create an indexed array
$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
// Step 2: Delete the element at index 1 ("banana")
unset($fruits[1]);
// Step 3: Reindex the array
$fruits = array_values($fruits);
// Display the result
print_r($fruits);
?>

OUTPUT
Array
(
    [0] => apple
    [1] => cherry
    [2] => date
)
