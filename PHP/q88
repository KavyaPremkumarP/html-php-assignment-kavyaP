88. Generate a simple PHP 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days between current day and birthday.

ANSWER
<?php
// Set your birthday (month and day)
$birthdayMonth = 12;
$birthdayDay = 25;
// Get current date
$today = new DateTime();
// Create a DateTime object for birthday this year
$currentYear = (int)$today->format('Y');
$birthdayThisYear = DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d', "$currentYear-$birthdayMonth-$birthdayDay");
// If birthday has already passed this year, set birthday to next year
if ($birthdayThisYear < $today) {
    $birthdayThisYear->modify('+1 year');
}
// Calculate difference
$interval = $today->diff($birthdayThisYear);
$daysLeft = $interval->days;

echo "Days left until birthday: $daysLeft";
?>

OUTPUT
Days left until birthday: 127
