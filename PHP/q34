Question 34
34. Replace all occurrences of a specific word with another word in a string using regular expressions in
PHP.
ANSWER
<?php
// Original string
$text = "The cat sat on the mat. The cat was happy.";
// Word to replace
$search = '\bcat\b'; // \b ensures "cat" is matched as a whole word
// Replacement word
$replace = 'dog';
// Replace using preg_replace
$result = preg_replace("/$search/", $replace, $text);
// Output result
echo $result;
?>

OUTPUT
The dog sat on the mat. The dog was happy.
