Question12
Write a program to check student grade based on marks:
Conditions:
If marks are 75% or more, the grade will be First Class.
If marks between 60% to 74%, grade will be second class.
If marks between 40% to 59%, grade will be third class.
If marks are less than 40%, students will be Fail.

ANSWER
<?php
// Function to determine the grade based on marks
function getGrade($marks) {
    if ($marks >= 75) {
        return "First Class";
    } elseif ($marks >= 60 && $marks < 75) {
        return "Second Class";
    } elseif ($marks >= 40 && $marks < 60) {
        return "Third Class";
    } else {
        return "Fail";
    }
}

// Ask for the number of students
echo "Enter number of students: ";
$students = (int)fgets(STDIN);

// Loop through each student
for ($i = 1; $i <= $students; $i++) {
    echo "\nStudent $i Name: ";
    $name = trim(fgets(STDIN));

    echo "Enter marks (out of 100): ";
    $marks = (float)fgets(STDIN);

    $grade = getGrade($marks);

    echo "$name's Grade: $grade\n";
}
?>



OUTPUT:
Enter number of students: 2

Student 1 Name: kavya
Enter marks (out of 100): 89
kavya's Grade: First Class

Student 2 Name: rithika
Enter marks (out of 100): 56
