// Initial balance
$balance = 1000;

while (true) {
    echo "\n--- Bank Menu ---\n";
    echo "1. Deposit\n";
    echo "2. Withdraw\n";
    echo "3. Check Balance\n";
    echo "4. Mini Statement\n";
    echo "5. Exit\n";

    $choice = (int) readline("Enter your choice: ");

    switch ($choice) {
        case 1: // Deposit
            $amount = (float) readline("Enter deposit amount: ");
            if ($amount > 0) {
                $balance += $amount;
                echo "Deposited ₹$amount successfully.\n";
            } else {
                echo "Invalid deposit amount.\n";
            }
            break;

        case 2: // Withdraw
            $amount = (float) readline("Enter withdrawal amount: ");
            if ($amount > $balance) {
                echo "Insufficient balance.\n";
            } elseif ($amount <= 0) {
                echo "Invalid withdrawal amount.\n";
            } else {
                $balance -= $amount;
                echo "Withdrew ₹$amount successfully.\n";
            }
            break;

        case 3: // Check Balance
            echo "Your current balance is ₹$balance\n";
            break;

        case 4: // Mini Statement
            $transactions = ["Deposit ₹500", "Withdraw ₹200", "Deposit ₹1000"];
            echo "Mini Statement:\n";
            foreach ($transactions as $t) {
                echo "- $t\n";
            }
            break;

        case 5: // Exit
            echo "Thank you for banking with us.\n";
            break 2;

        default:
            echo "Invalid choice. Please try again.\n";
    }

    $next = strtolower(readline("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): "));
    if ($next == "no") {
        echo "Session ended.\n";
        break;
    } elseif ($next != "yes") {
        echo "Invalid input, returning to menu...\n";
