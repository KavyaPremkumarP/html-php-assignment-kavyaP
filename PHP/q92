92. Apply the various steps involved to get cookie value using server-side scripting.

Steps to Get Cookie Value in PHP
Step 1: Set the Cookie (Usually in a previous request)
Before you can get a cookie, it must be set first:
Eg:// Set a cookie named "username"
      setcookie("username", "Alice", time() + 3600, "/");
     "username" = name of the cookie
     "Alice" = value
     time() + 3600 = expires in 1 hour
     "/" = available across the whole domain

Step 2: Access Cookie Value (In a subsequent request)
Once the cookie is set and the browser sends it back in the next request, you can read it using $_COOKIE:
Eg: if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
    echo "Welcome back, " . $_COOKIE['username'];
    } else {
    echo "Welcome, guest!";
   }

Step 3: Validate or Use the Cookie Data
Always validate cookie data before using it to prevent security issues:
Eg: $user = htmlspecialchars($_COOKIE['username'] ?? 'Guest');
    echo "Hello, $user!";

Step 4: Delete a Cookie
You can delete a cookie by setting its expiration time in the past:
Eg:setcookie("username", "", time() - 3600, "/");
